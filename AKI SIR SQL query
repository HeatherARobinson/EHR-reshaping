#Assessing SIR properties
SELECT DISTINCT PatID FROM table1- how many records are there in the 2014 freeze?
SELECT DISTINCT PatID FROM table1 WHERE YearOfBirth<=(EntryDate-18) –how many under 18s are there?
SELECT SourceID FROM table2 ORDER BY COUNT (PatID) -how many transient hospital patients are we omitting? Decide cutoff point for numbers of patients registered at each practise. Look up borderline practises to confirm location.
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE Rubric LIKE ‘%transplant%’ -which ReadCodes relate to transplants?
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE Rubric LIKE ‘%dialy%’ - which ReadCodes relate to dialysis?
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE Rubric LIKE ‘%RRT%’ – which additional ReadCodes relate to dialysis?
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE Rubric LIKE ‘%Creatinine%# -which ReadCodes relate to Creatinine?
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE Rubric LIKE ‘%GFR%# -which ReadCodes relate to eGFR?
SELECT CodeUnits  FROM table1 WHERE Rubric LIKE ‘%Creatinine%’ –how many different units are used with Creatinine? 

#Making record selection for extract
SELECT * FROM table1 INNER JOIN table 2 ON table1.PatID=table2.PatID 
WHERE ReadCode IS NOT IN (‘’,’’,’’,’’,) AND 
WHERE DATEPART(yy, yearofbirth)+18 <(DATEPART(yy, EntryDate) AND  
ReadCode IN (‘’,’’,’’,’’,… )AND
WHERE NOT SourceID is IN (‘’,’’,’’,’’,,,,…………………..)
Selects all unique columns from both tables where the read code excludes those predetermined for transplant or dialysis, and includes those identified for Creatinine, considering only patients over 18, and excluding those from practises outside of Salford.
